## General Information
- The purpose of the project was to develop my skills building a game from scratch and using the coding languages JS, HTML and CSS as part of the course. 
- I undertook the project as part of a course I undertook.


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (jQuery) - version ES6 
- HTML - version 5.0
- CSS - version 3.0


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Different levels where patterns become more complicated.
- Use keys to interact with the game.


## Usage
You can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated and you have to follow the pattern to keep going. 

## Project Status
Project is: _completed_


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Play again button to restart the game
- Include a scoring system

To do:
- Add a database where it stores previous player scores to tally the best player.
